This is a trained model of weight file (deposited at https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/320011e081b141a4a478/?dl=1, due to the file size) derived from YOLOv4 - Darknet neural network, the source code of YOLOv4 used to reproduce results can be found in https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet.git. The weight model is in coordination with automated single-cell/organoid distribution instrument (SCDI), applied in capillary orifice and single-cell/organoid recognition through CMOS digital camera (Daheng Optics, MER-U3-L).
